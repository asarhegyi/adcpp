The goal of this project is to develop a platform independent C++ based library for testing Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) which can improve the quality of ADC design by utilizing Analog Design for Testability (ADFT) methods and processing characterization results in the design phase. The tool has to be platform independent to be able to bridge the gap between Design, Test, Software, and Application engineers.

These algorithms can be used for:  
1.) Mixed-Signal simulations during the design phase of the ADC  
2.) Bench testing during bring-ups and CPK calculations  
3.) Built-In Self-Testing (BIST) of wafer and package units (class and sort BIST)  
4.) High level modeling of ADCs in IDE tools  
5.) Improving digital signal processing algorithms by utilizing nonlinear ADC models (f.i. decimation filters)
